## Problem statement

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| PS ID | SIH26265 |
| Title | Streamline of security deposit/ FDR portal |
| Organization | AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education) |
| Department | Regulation Bureau |
| Category | Software |
| Theme | Smart Automation |

**Background.** AICTE may require technical institutions to submit or maintain security deposits or Fixed Deposit Receipts (FDRs) as part of approval and compliance. Managing them means:

- keeping institution-wise records;
- verifying the instruments;
- monitoring validity and maturity;
- tracking renewal or replacement;
- recording release or refund requests;
- keeping documents available for regulatory verification.

**Current pain.** Fragmented records, manual correspondence and multiple trackers make it hard to keep an accurate, current view of deposit status, pending actions and time-sensitive requirements.

**What the PS asks for:**

- A secure, centralized portal that tracks every deposit across its lifecycle.
- The portal must distinguish what an institution *submitted* from what a bank or financial source has *independently confirmed*.
- The prototype must show measurable improvement in:
  - record accuracy;
  - verification turnaround time;
  - timely renewal monitoring;
  - manual tracking effort;
  - visibility into pending cases.
